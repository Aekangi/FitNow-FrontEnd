### **_Future Updates_**

- Make User Profiles so the user can save the diet plan and workout on a single page rather than scroll through the content to find videos or plans again.
- Have a search bar to search single items.
- Add paypall so the user has to pay to view the plan. If they don't want to pay, they're able to only view the dinner for a single day.
